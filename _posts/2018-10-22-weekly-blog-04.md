Last week, we continued on our flag project. We learned how to bring our flags to life using code. I chose the Vietnam flag because it is simple to recreate. We went on the website WeScheme and got straight to work. I personally created my flag in about 15 minutes. Then, I moved on to create the Japanese flag which was also pretty basic. I chose these simple flags because I'm new to the whole coding thing so I wanted to take it easy for the beginning of the first semester.

More on the personal side by the time I post this blog, a few days have passed since the PBC trip. It was a great trip and it exposed me to more of the freshman I have things in common with. My advice to you, Mr.Allata, is to change your GitHub colors. No offense, but the orange,pink,and white was god-awful.
