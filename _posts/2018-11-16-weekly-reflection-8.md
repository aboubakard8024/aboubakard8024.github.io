Hello reader. I got to class a little bit late today due to the train but that's no excuse to not tell you what I've learned this week in CS. This week, we learned the difference between values and function definitions. For the do-now, we were creating definitons that would define our age,eye color,and name. Then, we transitioned and we figured out that functions have outputs meanwhile values are what are plugged in to match the outputs. On Thursday, Mr.Allata assesed us on how we could model a rocket blasting upwards. I personally said that we could model it in CS fashion by creating a image of a rocket using shapes. Many of my classmates had different ideas and some even asked questions like "What kind of rocket is it?" or "Where's it's destination?".Then, we did a walk around the room and had to notice the similarities we all had when thinking about how to create this rocket. It turns out a whole bunch of us had the same ideas such as creating images and using posn to move it upwards.

This week was overall a solid week of CS. We went over some topics we weren't completely sure about and I think the class as a whole had a better understanding on some older topics we brushed open.
