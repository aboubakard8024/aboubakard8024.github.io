 This week, we have learned many valuable things. First, we learned about function definitions. We learned that the first value of the inner circle can affect the final value of the function. We also learned about how to connect contracts and expreesions. We learned how to match using keyphrases in the expression. We also learned how contracts looked in real-life situations.
 
 This week, i feel I could've improved in raising my hand. I pay attention in class most of the time but when it comes to raising my hand, I hesitate I guess. This is something I've slowly been trying to get into.
