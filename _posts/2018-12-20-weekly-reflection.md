## Flag of Greece by Abou Diarrassouba

## Describe your program

-   I created the Greece flag and I tried my best to make it scalable.
- I honestly expect a Apprentice and up on this project because I actually tried on this project. I spent days going through multiple errors until I was finally even able to make my first stripe. Then I had to create the second one which was harder than the first for me. Since this project isn't based on completion,I believe I have a shot at getting a decent grade.



## Current output

-   Insert an image that your program currently produces. _then delete this instruction_

## Describe your process.

I recieved alot of help from my peers, especially David M. and Emir. When I didn't have my first stripe, David showed me how I could create it and tried to help me with the second stripe. Emir helped me create my second stripe. I've now been trying to create more stripes and the other shapes that are in the Greek flag.
