  This week in CS, we learned about understanding functions. We learned about fast functions today and we completed a worksheet about it. We basically were creating equations using the information we were given on the paper. We would have to notice the difference between the two examples we had to create. Using that, we would define our function. We were suppoised to have time to test some of our new fuctions on WeScheme but we ran a little behind schedule.
