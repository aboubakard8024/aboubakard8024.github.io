The MyFlag project wasn't all that successful for me. I didn't measure the flag in any way so my lines were not equal and some were even slanted. My flag was a perfect rectangle however the stripes in it were the problem.

A challenge I had this week was having to measure the flag's lenth and width. I could fix this problem by simply follwing directions and choosing to not be lazy. If i do thoses thinmgs, the next CS project I do will be easier for me
