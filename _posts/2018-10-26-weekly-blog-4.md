Today, we have reached 1/3 of the first semester. 6 weeks have passed and their are 12 more weeks to go until the end of the semester. In this first semester, we've learned alot about coding. The first main things we learned were coding terms such as HTML, CSS, WYSIWIGS, and Markup languages. We obviously had to learn the terminologies before we started throwing those words around. Then, we were introduced to a website called GithubPages. This website allowed us to create our own sort of basic website where we could publish learning blogs such as the one I'm typing right now. We followed a tutorial on how to create these sites, however, it still took me forever to create a working Github Page. Soon after GitHub, we were told that eventually we would create a video game. Not a video game like a Grand Theft Auto or a Call Of Duty, but more of a simple game like a BongoCat. Simpler games that could easily be coded using images and coordinates. We were taught the importance of coordinates and how it affects the location of a image. Later on, we learned about how we can style our GitHub pages using the CSS file we created with it. We were exposed to a website called https://www.colourlovers.com/ which has many color palletes you can use on your websites to change the colors of it.
