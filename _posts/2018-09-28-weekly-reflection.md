This week, we learned about coordinates and how they affect video games. We also learned about order of operations. I learned that it is extremely important to put things in order for the computer because the computers are "dumb" in a way and won't realize the mistakes you made. I also learned that coordinates affect the location of everything in the game. Overall, this was a good week and I've learned quite a bit this week.
