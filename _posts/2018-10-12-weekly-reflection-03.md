#Our Learning
We learned many things in CS this week. On Tuesday, we briefly learned about how contracts are ignored by computers. We also learned how to make phrases represent functions such as FRED. In Thursday's class, we did a activity where my partner and I would code difficult shapes using the information we learned previously about functions. Today, we learned about how we can make our learning blogs better by seperating them into two paragraphs.
