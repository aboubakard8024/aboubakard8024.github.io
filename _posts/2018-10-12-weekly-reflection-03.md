#Our Learning
We learned many things in CS this week. On Tuesday, we briefly learned about how contracts are ignored by computers. We also learned how to make phrases represent functions such as FRED. In Thursday's class, we did a activity where my partner and I would code difficult shapes using the information we learned previously about functions. Today, we learned about how we can make our learning blogs better by seperating them into two paragraphs. 

#My Learning
This week was successful in general. One challenge I faced this week was finishing my flag, I thought thr flag I chose was simple but I wanted the star in the middle of the flag too be perfect so my pace was atrocious. Anyways, for the class to keep moving smoothly,I think Mr.Allata should keep throwing in small jokes just to keep the class entertained but we have to work on recovery from jokes.
